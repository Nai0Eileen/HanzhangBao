            <h1>What is my value</h1>
            <p>As an Information Science student with a minor in Economics at the University of Pittsburgh, I bring a unique perspective to Game Design and Development. My academic journey has instilled in me a strong foundation in both the technical aspects of game creation and an understanding of the economic factors that impact the gaming industry. I am deeply passionate about leveraging this knowledge to develop games that are not only engaging and entertaining but also innovative and provoking. With a focus on building immersive worlds and compelling content, I strive to push the boundaries of what games can be and how they can impact players.</p>
            <p>In addition to my passion for Game Design and Development, I am also deeply engaged with Data Analysis and Visualization. These fields allow me to delve into complex datasets to unearth insights that can stand alone or enhance various projects. My approach involves using machine learning algorithms to dissect and understand data, identifying trends and patterns that are not immediately obvious. By presenting data in clear, compelling visual formats, I make complex information accessible and actionable for diverse audiences.</p>
            <p>Finally, in the realm of UX/UI Design, my focus is on creating user-centric interfaces that are intuitive and visually appealing. I apply principles of design thinking to ensure that digital interactions are seamless and engaging, enhancing the overall user experience. This discipline allows me to bring a practical, aesthetic, and functional sensibility to various projects, ensuring that the users find delight and ease in the digital environments I help craft.</p>
